1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project was to display two clocks, one with military time, and one with a conventional 12 hour clock. The user would be able to input from a menu whether to add hours, minutes, seconds, or exit the program. 

2. What did you do particularly well?

I think I was able to trouble shoot a lot of the little issues that weren't seen at first through extensive troubleshooting. The clocks would sometimes misalign, not switch to AM/PM appropriately, or not handle overflow well like when the minute goes from 59 to 60 and adds an hour. 

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could have added error handling to the program. 
   
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part of the code to write for me was the seconds and minutes transitioning past 60 and iterating the next value up. 

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This project was really hands-on, where I could actively see what I was working on. It was something tangible. I think really paying attention to logical errors is transferable to other projects or course work, because a lot of the time the program would run like it was suppose to at first without syntax errors, then errors would spring up as you used the program. 

5. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by organizing it well and adding comments to the code.
